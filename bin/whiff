#pod F<which> is a useful utility, found on most unix systems.  It gives you the

#pod Unfortunately, it does two stupid things:  first, if it can't find one, it
#pod prints an error message to stdout; secondly, if you give it multiple arguments,
#pod it assumes you want one line per argument, each like calling which
#pod individually.
#pod
#pod F<whiff> assumes that all the arguments form a best-first list of alternatives,
#pod and only prints the path to the first alternative found in the path.  If none
#pod is found, it prints an error (to stderr!) and exits with an error code.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

F<which> is a useful utility, found on most unix systems.  It gives you the
absolute path for the first occurance of a program in your path.
Unfortunately, it does two stupid things:  first, if it can't find one, it
prints an error message to stdout; secondly, if you give it multiple arguments,
it assumes you want one line per argument, each like calling which
individually.

F<whiff> assumes that all the arguments form a best-first list of alternatives,
and only prints the path to the first alternative found in the path.  If none
is found, it prints an error (to stderr!) and exits with an error code.
